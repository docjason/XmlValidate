XmlValidate
===========

A quick & flexible open source XML validator capable of performing bulk validation of XML documents against XML Schemas as defined in the XML documents or forcing another schema target.

*XmlValidate* validates individual XML documents by filename or URL
or recursively searching directories with a list of target file
extensions. First documents are checked as being well-formed XML.
If parsing XML with non-validating parser fails then validation for that
file stops.

Here are three ways to validate XML documents using *XmlValidate*:

1. The *-map* option maps schema namespaces to given target schema locations.
It rewrites XML with location of schema instance document then validates against
target schema. If schema namespace is not found then it does not validate
the document. This validates the document against the actual schema namespace
defined in the document as opposed to the other approaches that rewrite
the XML documents to any target schema.

  old: &lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1">

  new: &lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1 file:/C:/xml/kml21.xsd"&gt;
 
 Note if root element is "kml" and no namespace is specified then KML 2.0 namespace is used to validate document.
 
2. Specifing a schema without a namespace implies noNamespaceSchemaLocation attribute should be added to all XML documents and validate against that schema.
  no namespace schema:

     &lt;event xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="C:/cot/schema/Event.xsd"&gt;
 
3. And finally specify -ns and -schema options to provide a target namespace URI and schema location.  All XML documents specified in search location(s) will be rewritten and the target schemaLocation will be used regardless of the default namespace of that document.  So for example KML 2.1 documents can be validated against the 2.2 schema, and vice versa.

     old: &lt;kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1"&gt;

     new: &lt;kml xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2 file:/C:/xml/kml22.xsd"&gt;

Note that XML is reformatted so errors/warnings with line/column numbers are respect to
the reformatted content not the original so context is printed at that line/column number
after each error in order that errors can be tracked down and corrected in original
XML document. If you want the reformatted XML document printed then use *-dump* mode.
If the error is in the XML Schema not the instance document then the context will not be printed.

Building with Gradle
--------------------

Type: ./gradlew test install

The first time you run this it will download and install gradle. Downloaded files (including the Gradle
distribution itself) will be stored in the Gradle user home directory (typically "<user_home>/.gradle").
Subsequent runs will be much faster.

If [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) is already installed then just run:

./gradle test install

Usage
-----

Usage: *xv* [options] [-map=file] | [-schema=file (-ns=uri)] &lt;xml-document file, URL, or directory...&gt;

Examples 
--------

1. To check all .kml files against target KML 2.2 schema regardless of default schema used:

     `xv -kml -schema C:/pathToXsd/kml22.xsd -ns=http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2  C:/pathToMyKmlFiles`
 
2. To check kml and kmz files against local schemas as defined in KML files: 

     `xv -kmz -map=ns.map C:/pathToMyKmlFiles`

3. Validate by URL for KML and target schema and print KML content
   if any errors are found but limit size of each file printed to first 4K: 
   
     `xv -dump -maxDump=4096 -ns=http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1  -schema=http://code.google.com/apis/kml/schema/kml21.xsd  http://kml-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/kml/kmz/simple/big.kmz`
 
Note: *xv* command in examples above is a short-cut to the provided .bat command using java and XmlValidate.jar on the CLASSPATH or by using an equivalent shell script.
See xv.bat, kml21.bat, and kml22.bat for example usage.
